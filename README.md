- **Documentation**: Inline documentation explaining the code structure and logic.
- **Tests**: Comprehensive test suite covering all aspects of the DNS server functionality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo installed on your machine. You can install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codescalersinternships/dnsserver-nabil/tree/development
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd dnsserver-nabil
   ```

3. Build the project:

   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

### Command Line Options
This is the result of running hermes -h
```bash
A simple DNS server application

Usage: dnsserver-nabil [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -p, --port <PORT>              Port to bind the UDP socket [default: 2053]
  -f, --forward-ip <FORWARD_IP>  forward replies to specified dns server
  -h, --help                     Print help
  -V, --version                  Print version
```
### Running the Server

To run the DNS server, use the following command:

```bash
make run
```

### Running Tests

To ensure everything is working correctly, you can run the test suite with:

```bash
make test
```



## Usage

Once the server is running, you can send DNS queries using any DNS client or command-line tools like `dig` or `nslookup`. For example:

```bash
dig @localhost -p 2053 google.com
```
